How to verify this license with GnuPG (this requires basic knowledge of a
computer's command prompt/terminal):
1. Open your operating system's command prompt or terminal. Type `gpg --help`.
   The top of the program's output should look something like `gpg (GnuPG) 2.2`.
   If you get errors about the file not being found, try variations such as:
      a. `gpg2 --help`
      b. `./gpg --help`
      c. `./gpg2 --help`
   If none of these methods work, please use your favorite Internet search
   engine to look for instructions on how to install GnuPG on your computer. Be
   sure to add the name of your computer's operating system at the end of your
   search query, or you might get confusing instructions.
2. Navigate to the directory where this file is stored. Usually this is done
   with `cd /some/folder/where/this/file/is/located` on your command prompt/
   terminal. You might be able to use your favorite file manager to locate this
   file and copy down the exact path of the folder it's in.
3. This file should have come with a file called `LICENSE.asc` in the same
   folder. Please type `gpg --import LICENSE.asc` to install my public key. This
   will use a few kilobytes of storage space on your computer, which is
   relatively nothing nowadays.
4. It's most likely this file is called `LICENSE.sig`. Type `gpg --verify
   LICENSE.sig`, and see if GPG says it's valid. (If it is invalid, then your
   copy of this license may have been damaged or modified on its way to you. Or
   you may not have installed my public key correctly.) Ignore warnings about
   the key not being certified, as long as the second line says EXACTLY `gpg:
   Good signature from "Akshat Singh (This is my main signing key for literally
   everything.) <HackerDaGreat57@gmail.com>"`. The primary key fingerprint
   should be `73B0 B0C2 2788 E712 A286  55DC 8739 6D8F D63D F284`.
